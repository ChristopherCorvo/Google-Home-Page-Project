Project Summary: Create a google homepage using HTML and CSS

This was my first project ever that involved the use of CSS and HTML. It was a very challenging project but what was interesting was that by being thrown into the deep end you were forced to learn how to swim. I actually found that I learned alot and was suprised that I was able to create what in my mind is a pretty close copy of Google's homepage. Even though much of the code is cobbled together from a variety of sources I feel that I have begun to understand how the different pieces are beginning to fit. 

Things I learned:
1) Flexbox: flex box was very useful at helping with layout. 
2) how to add icons via web links
3) how to build a search form
4) how to ask questions and find answers via google
5) etc

Things to learn:
1) how to target an icon in a form specifically - I would have liked to have moved the magnifying search icon and app icon in the top right.
2) How to make the input form in the search area look uniform. Right now when you click in the search box it displays a rectangular input box
3) How to better use flexbox... I abandoned flexbox when trying to stick the footer to the bottom and placed view height parameters so that when you minimize the screen or if you looked at it via a mobile device it would probably distort the spacing. 

** one thing to note is that I did not use the 'inspect' developer feature at all.
